## Setting Up Your Python Environment

### Step 1: Install Python
1. Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the latest version suitable for your operating system.
3. During installation, check the option to **"Add Python to PATH"** for easy access from the terminal.

### Step 2: Install an IDE or Code Editor
An IDE helps you write, run, and debug your code efficiently. Popular choices include:
- **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)**: Beginner-friendly IDE.
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: Lightweight and extensible editor.
- **[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)**: Ideal for interactive coding.

### Step 3: Verify Your Installation
Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see the installed Python version displayed.

## Writing Your First Python Program

### Hello, World!
Letâ€™s start with a classic "Hello, World!" program:
```python showLineNumbers
print("Hello, World!")
```
Run the program in your IDE or terminal to see the output.

## Python Basics

### Variables and Data Types
Variables are used to store data, and Python supports various data types:
```python showLineNumbers
# Variables and their types
name = "Alice"        # String
age = 25              # Integer
height = 5.7          # Float
is_student = True     # Boolean

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Student: {is_student}")
```

### Type Conversion
Convert one data type to another:
```python showLineNumbers
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Converts input string to an integer
print(f"Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.")
```

### Comments
Comments are notes in the code for better readability:
```python showLineNumbers
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a multi-line comment
spanning multiple lines.
"""
```

---

## Control Structures

### Conditional Statements
Control the flow of your program using `if`, `elif`, and `else`:
```python showLineNumbers
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")
```

### Loops
#### For Loop
Execute a block of code multiple times:
```python showLineNumbers
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Number: {i}")
```

#### While Loop
Repeat a block of code while a condition is true:
```python showLineNumbers
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```

---

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code:
```python showLineNumbers
def greet(name):
    """This function greets a person by name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

### Built-in Functions
Python provides many built-in functions:
```python showLineNumbers
# Common functions
print(len("Python"))          # Length of a string
print(max(10, 20, 30))        # Maximum value
print(round(5.678, 2))        # Rounding to 2 decimal places
```

---

## Data Structures

### Lists
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable:
```python showLineNumbers
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs:
```python showLineNumbers
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
print(person["name"])  # Alice
```

### Tuples
Tuples are immutable lists:
```python showLineNumbers
coordinates = (10, 20)
print(coordinates[0])  # 10
```

### Sets
Sets store unique values:
```python showLineNumbers
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## Python Libraries

Explore some popular Python libraries:

1. **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
2. **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
4. **Flask/Django**: Web development frameworks.
5. **TensorFlow**: Machine learning and AI.

## Mini-Project: Guess the Number Game
Letâ€™s build a simple game to guess a random number:
```python showLineNumbers
import random

def guess_the_number():
    number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!")
    print("I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?")

    while True:
        guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
        attempts += 1

        if guess < number:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > number:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed it in {attempts} attempts.")
            break

guess_the_number()
```

## Next Steps

1. Practice more with Python's **advanced concepts** like classes and modules.
2. Work on small projects like a calculator, to-do app, or quiz game.
3. Explore **Python libraries** to expand your skill set.
